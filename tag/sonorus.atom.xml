&lt;p&gt;In an earlier post I gave an outline of my project, and mentioned that I am 
currently working on an aircraft emission model for auralization. Since then I 
developed a fully automated method to extract features from aircraft recordings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The method is roughly as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backpropagate from source to receiver in time-domain, undoing the Doppler 
shift, atmospheric attenuation and spreading. The ground effect is ignored for 
now. We now have a signal that roughly corresponds to what is emitted from the 
airplane.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine fundamental frequency. An aircraft spectrum consists mostly of noise 
and tones, which are mostly harmonics. Knowing the fundamental frequency, allows 
you to determine the power of not only the fundamental, but also of each 
harmonic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And that is the final step. Determine power of the tones, and consider the 
rest of the spectrum as noise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan is now to determine these features from a large amount of events and 
develop a basic emission model. But before then, its important to already ask 
the following question. Are these features sufficient to create a realistic 
emission signal? Or, even better, are these features, taking into account the 
developed propagation model, providing a realistic signal at the receiver? Does, 
what you hear, really sound like an aircraft? That's in the end what we're 
after, right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Synthesis of emission&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test whether the obtained features are sufficient to reproduce a realistic 
auralization, I considered a couple of events, and extracted the features for 
each. I synthesized an emission signal by summing all these time-varying 
components (about 200 tones and 30 1/3-octave bands), linearly interpolating the 
samples (features were obtained every second) and smoothing the interpolated 
components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://zenodo.org/record/28815/files/synthesis.wav"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; to listen 
to a synthesis of the emission. It's an Airbus A320 taking of from Zurich Airport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part of the fragment you can hear the tonal components quite clearly 
but in the latter part noise takes over. This is due to the directivity of the 
components; tones generated by the fan blades radiate mostly forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For comparison, &lt;a href="https://zenodo.org/record/28815/files/reverted.wav"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is the backpropagated signal. You'll notice it sounds very 
different. This is because the (unwanted) ground effect is still in it. And 
because of it, it sounds much more already like an actual aircraft fly-over!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;At the receiver&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let's listen now at a receiver at a height of 4 meters above the ground. 
When the aircraft is closest by, the distance is about 180 meters. Here are two 
fragments: &lt;a href="https://zenodo.org/record/28815/files/recording.wav"&gt;fragment A&lt;/a&gt; and 
&lt;a href="https://zenodo.org/record/28815/files/auralization.wav"&gt;fragment B&lt;/a&gt;. One is a 
full auralization, the other is a recording. Can you hear which is which?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(hint: look at the URL in the top part of your browser if you want to know for sure)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two quite noticeable differences between the recording and the 
auralization. This specific auralization does not include the effects of 
turbulence, and the level of the blade passing frequency is lower than it should 
be.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a repost of a &lt;a href="https://sonorusfp7.wordpress.com/2015/08/21/synthesis-of-aircraft-emission-and-propagation"&gt;post of mine&lt;/a&gt; at the SONORUS blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

airstrip of the base is not that far from where I work. Often you can see 
paratroopers and helicopters or hear other aircraft take off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, one of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Air_Force#Air_demonstration_teams"&gt;demonstration teams&lt;/a&gt; practices.
So far I've only seen the PC-7 Team, which use Swiss-manufactered &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilatus_PC-7"&gt;Pilatus PC-7&lt;/a&gt; turbo prop trainers.
These aircraft can be quite noisy. Actually, it's not that the sound is very loud, it's just that the sound can be 
annoying. The propellors have a strong directivity and therefore, as they do their maneuvers, the level goes up and down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They don't practice that often, and their sessions generally don't last more 
than a couple of hours. Therefore, I can't really be bothered too much by it. 
If I hear them, and it bothers me, I just close my window or turn the music up a 
bit. But what astonishes me is that they actually do these activities above 
dense populated areas. Many people are living and working in the area. What if 
an accident occurs? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize there aren't many places in Switzerland where they could build 
airstrips and do this kind of training without flying over someone's home. But 
flying over a dense area like this or flying over one or two farms is quite a 
difference. I am curious now to their risk assessment and how they've 
eventually decided to keep doing these activities here.&lt;/p&gt;

visit. As I wrote in my previous post it was strange to be there again. Last 
spring I visited Gothenburg for just a couple of days, but now, staying for 
seven weeks again is quite different. You start noticing quite a lot of things 
have changed. Many people I knew there have moved away and I also noticed a 
couple of restaurants I visited have closed since. Despite those things it was nice meeting old friends again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as I wrote in the title I went there on a research visit. The main reason 
for my visit was to attend some courses at Chalmers but to also work on my 
research. Initially the idea was to investigate further the model we're 
developing to deal with atmospheric turbulence in aircraft auralisations. 
However, in the end the courses took more time then I expected, so I didn't 
really get to work on the turbulence model anymore. However, I did manage to 
implement one nice part of the auralisation tool, namely support for Ambisonics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides Chalmers I also visited SP in Borås. SP was a familar place for me as 
well since I did an 
&lt;a href="https://fridh.nl/thermoacoustic-refrigerator/"&gt;internship&lt;/a&gt; there in 2010. 
Earlier I had made recordings with a SoundField microphone, however, at Empa we 
do not have an Ambisonics setup. SP has a listening room with a third order 
Ambisonics system, giving me the possibility to listen to the first order 
recording as well as to higher order auralisations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One visit I met up with Peter Lundén who installed the system. After some problem solving we managed to 
get both the recordings and auralisations working. Unfortunately there was one 
problem with the auralisations, somehow halfway the aircraft makes a U-turn. 
While I haven't checked it any further, I think it is due to 
the inclusion of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambisonic_data_exchange_formats#Polarity"&gt;Condon-Shortley phase&lt;/a&gt; 
in the &lt;a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.special.sph_harm.html"&gt;function&lt;/a&gt; I used to calculate the spherical harmonics.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After the ASA meeting in Indianapolis I went to Gothenburg again for a research

place in the city of Krakow, Poland. From Monday till Friday there were
presentations as well as meetings of technical committees. The
presentations covered a wide range of topics like structural acoustics,
human response and auralisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A special session was organised on Urban Sound Planning as well, in
which many of my &lt;a href="http://www.fp7sonorus.eu/"&gt;project members&lt;/a&gt; presented
their current work. I'm glad a lot of people attended the session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave a presentation with the title &lt;em&gt;Modelling sound propagation in the
presence of turbulence for the auralisation of aircraft noise&lt;/em&gt; in a
session on Environmental Acoustics. This session was Friday morning
early, which was a bit unfortunate, considering there was a nice party
with the &lt;a href="https://www.euracoustics.org/activities/yan"&gt;Young Acousticians Network&lt;/a&gt; the evening
before. I was surprised there were still so many people that morning!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday I joined a discussion on benchmarking for computational
acoustics. When implementing a model you would like to be able to
validate this. This can sometimes be difficult due to lack of available
information or benchmarks. Therefore, the idea is now to put online some
kind of repository where people can put their benchmarks. Considering
this is a topic of interest in other fields of science I am really
curious how they deal with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city of Krakow surprised me a lot. It's quite a green city and there
seems to be a good and relaxed mood. There's plenty of pubs and
restaurants, especially around the main square which is huge.&lt;/p&gt;

and spectral contents fluctuate somewhat. These fluctuations are due to
turbulence in the atmosphere, affecting the sound generation (variable
load on engines) and the sound propagation. In order to create a
plausible auralisation of aircraft noise these fluctuations have to be
accounted for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turbulent flow can be modeled as a superposition of a spectrum of
fluctuations and eddies upon a mean flow.&amp;nbsp;A common approach for noise
predictions methods to include the effects of atmospheric turbulence is
to use a statistical approach; generate many random 'frozen' turbulence
fields, calculate for each of these how sound propagates through them
and then average your results. The 'frozen' fields represent snapshots
in time of how the atmosphere could look like. These snapshots are
calculated based on a spectrum of fluctuations. Well known descriptions
of these spectra are the Gaussian and von Karman spectra.&lt;/p&gt;

as a Network Meeting and this was also the first time for us, ESR's, to
meet each other and all other partners involved in this project. SONORUS
is an Initial Training Network under the FP7 People Programme in the
field of Urban Sound Planning, aiming at improving the acoustic
environment of our cities in a holistic approach. In the project, 14
young researchers (ESR's) work together on improving the soundscape of
several cities in conjunction with their individual research projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday evening prior to the winterschool there was a dinner for all
those involved in the project, a very pleasant way to get to know each
other. On Monday morning the Network Meeting began. An introduction to
the project was given by the project leader and the research partners
also presented themselves. Juergen Bauer of WIT then gave a talk named
'Urban sound planning in the bigger context' stressing the importance of
Urban Sound Planning. That afternoon the ESR's presented themselves as
well as the involved city partners showing their cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday morning the winterschool truly began. From then on every day was
packed with lectures and workshops. The winterschool dealt with urban
sound propagation and therefore sound propagation and modelling
technique were extensively discussed along with standard methods and the
European Noise Directive. The winterschool was concluded on Friday with
a small exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A topic that briefly passed by during a presentation of Timothy van
Renterghem seemed to have impressed me quite a bit. He briefly showed
the results from his research on the importance of rooftops for road
traffic noise shielding. Basically, the shape of a rooftop can have
great influence on how much sound is diffracted and thus how quiet a
courtyard could potentially become.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tuesday afternoon we had an initial look together at the test cases
and groups were formed to see how they would tackle the problems that
were presented. Each group discussed a single test site and concluded
the session with a presentation about their initial impressions of the
challenge at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right from the start of this week project members started discussing
their work and how they might cooperate. Thursday after the lectures I
gave a short presentation on tools for collaboration resulting in a
brief discussion on the topic. While we were all too tired to go into
the details at the time my general impression was that the&amp;nbsp;consensus&amp;nbsp;was
that we should definitely look deeper into these kind of tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all I think this meeting was quite fruitful and I'm looking
forward to the next time!&lt;/p&gt;

as a Network Meeting and this was also the first time for us, ESR's, to
meet each other and all other partners involved in this project. SONORUS
is an Initial Training Network under the FP7 People Programme in the
field of Urban Sound Planning, aiming at improving the acoustic
environment of our cities in a holistic approach. In the project, 14
young researchers (ESR's) work together on improving the soundscape of
several cities in conjunction with their individual research projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday evening prior to the winterschool there was a dinner for all
those involved in the project, a very pleasant way to get to know each
other. On Monday morning the Network Meeting began. An introduction to
the project was given by the project leader and the research partners
also presented themselves. Juergen Bauer of WIT then gave a talk named
'Urban sound planning in the bigger context' stressing the importance of
Urban Sound Planning. That afternoon the ESR's presented themselves as
well as the involved city partners showing their cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday morning the winterschool truly began. From then on every day was
packed with lectures and workshops. The winterschool dealt with urban
sound propagation and therefore sound propagation and modelling
technique were extensively discussed along with standard methods and the
European Noise Directive. The winterschool was concluded on Friday with
a small exam.&lt;/p&gt;

Empa in Dübendorf, Switzerland, as part of a European Seventh Framework
project called &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.fp7sonorus.eu/"&gt;Sonorus&lt;/a&gt;. The project is about urban sound planning and
my task is to develop an aircraft noise simulator. &amp;nbsp;The first two months
passed really fast. It's a great place to work, and the type of work
really fits me. Obviously I began with reading a bit about the topic and
thinking how I would tackle the issues at hand. But very soon I began
with implementing the first bits and mainly prototyping what I think it
should become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is that I develop an aircraft noise simulator capable of
simulating how an aircraft pass-by sounds at a stationary receiver while
in an urban environment. This means effects like spherical spreading,
Doppler shift and reflections at the ground and facades have to be
included in the propagation model. But first it is important to obtain a
good time-frequency representation of an aircraft, and obviously these
depend on the make or type of the aircraft as well as the conditions.
Finally, the aircraft noise has to be reproduced using for example an
Ambisonics setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there are quite some challenges here and 'unknowns' to be solved .
While I have a good idea of how I will build such a tool for
auralisation, there are many details requiring attention. An example is
how much does turbulence in the atmosphere influence the propagation?
How to simulate decorrelation? How to reproduce correct over-head
information? And quite some more questions that need answering the
coming three years :-)&lt;/p&gt;
