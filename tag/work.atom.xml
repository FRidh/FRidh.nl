visit. As I wrote in my previous post it was strange to be there again. Last 
spring I visited Gothenburg for just a couple of days, but now, staying for 
seven weeks again is quite different. You start noticing quite a lot of things 
have changed. Many people I knew there have moved away and I also noticed a 
couple of restaurants I visited have closed since. Despite those things it was nice meeting old friends again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as I wrote in the title I went there on a research visit. The main reason 
for my visit was to attend some courses at Chalmers but to also work on my 
research. Initially the idea was to investigate further the model we're 
developing to deal with atmospheric turbulence in aircraft auralisations. 
However, in the end the courses took more time then I expected, so I didn't 
really get to work on the turbulence model anymore. However, I did manage to 
implement one nice part of the auralisation tool, namely support for Ambisonics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides Chalmers I also visited SP in Borås. SP was a familar place for me as 
well since I did an 
&lt;a href="https://fridh.nl/thermoacoustic-refrigerator/"&gt;internship&lt;/a&gt; there in 2010. 
Earlier I had made recordings with a SoundField microphone, however, at Empa we 
do not have an Ambisonics setup. SP has a listening room with a third order 
Ambisonics system, giving me the possibility to listen to the first order 
recording as well as to higher order auralisations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One visit I met up with Peter Lundén who installed the system. After some problem solving we managed to 
get both the recordings and auralisations working. Unfortunately there was one 
problem with the auralisations, somehow halfway the aircraft makes a U-turn. 
While I haven't checked it any further, I think it is due to 
the inclusion of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambisonic_data_exchange_formats#Polarity"&gt;Condon-Shortley phase&lt;/a&gt; 
in the &lt;a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.special.sph_harm.html"&gt;function&lt;/a&gt; I used to calculate the spherical harmonics.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After the ASA meeting in Indianapolis I went to Gothenburg again for a research

place in the city of Krakow, Poland. From Monday till Friday there were
presentations as well as meetings of technical committees. The
presentations covered a wide range of topics like structural acoustics,
human response and auralisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A special session was organised on Urban Sound Planning as well, in
which many of my &lt;a href="http://www.fp7sonorus.eu/"&gt;project members&lt;/a&gt; presented
their current work. I'm glad a lot of people attended the session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave a presentation with the title &lt;em&gt;Modelling sound propagation in the
presence of turbulence for the auralisation of aircraft noise&lt;/em&gt; in a
session on Environmental Acoustics. This session was Friday morning
early, which was a bit unfortunate, considering there was a nice party
with the &lt;a href="https://www.euracoustics.org/activities/yan"&gt;Young Acousticians Network&lt;/a&gt; the evening
before. I was surprised there were still so many people that morning!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday I joined a discussion on benchmarking for computational
acoustics. When implementing a model you would like to be able to
validate this. This can sometimes be difficult due to lack of available
information or benchmarks. Therefore, the idea is now to put online some
kind of repository where people can put their benchmarks. Considering
this is a topic of interest in other fields of science I am really
curious how they deal with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city of Krakow surprised me a lot. It's quite a green city and there
seems to be a good and relaxed mood. There's plenty of pubs and
restaurants, especially around the main square which is huge.&lt;/p&gt;

in Oslo, Norway. In May I was offered a position for the summer at the
Noise &amp;amp; Vibration section at &lt;a href="http://www.dnv.com/"&gt;Det Norske Veritas&lt;/a&gt; in Høvik. Thus far I
am quite content with the work. I've been traveling a lot across Norway
for noise and vibration measurements (DNV Comfort Class) and I've
started working on noise and vibration predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oslo seems to be a nice city as well. Especially the location where I
live; everything is basically around the corner. Commuting time is
acceptable and nature can be reached in about half an hour.
Unfortunately I haven't really been able to see much of the nature
outside Oslo due to the bad weather and a bad fever last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coming week I am having off from work, and what way to spend it
better than to go hiking! Monday I will take the bus/train to Liomseter
from where I will hike for five days along the final part of
Jotunheimstien. Last week I bought all the gear (ouch, Gore-Tex is
expensive!!) I think I will need for this and future trips. What future
trips, you might ask. Well, at least end of next month I intend to walk
the &lt;a href="Kungsleden: http://www.svenskaturistforeningen.se/en/Discover-Sweden/Facilities-and-activities/Lappland/kingstrail/"&gt;Kungsleden&lt;/a&gt; in Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, summer thus far has been quite nice with visiting The
Netherlands again, as well as attending &lt;a href="http://www.hultsfredsfestivalen.se/"&gt;Hultsfredsfestivalen&lt;/a&gt; in
Sweden. And with the forecast of the hiking trips it only seems to
become better :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To end this post I have here a nice recording of the Norwegian band
Katzenjammer, who were playing at Hultsfredsfestivalen as well, though
this is a recording from elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
