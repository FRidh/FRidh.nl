                <div class="entry-content"> <p>It's four weeks now that I am back in Sweden. June the 2nd I arrived
back home in Gothenburg. It was quite a change, for sure! But it was
definitely good. I really enjoyed my 4.5 months India experience, but
after some time I was starting to feel like being home again. Let's give
a short summary of the last month or so in India.</p>
<p>I spend almost a month in McLeodGanj, a town a liked and disliked. There
are so many foreign tourists, that you don't have the feeling you're in
India. And this is both a positive and negative thing I found. Anyway,
during my stay there I met again several travelers from before which was
very nice! It's good to see some familiar faces once in a while. After
McLeodGanj - including a night at the Snowline Cafe - I headed to
Srinagar, Kashmir. It was quite a long bus journey; first a 5 hour ride
from Dharamsala to Jammu, and after that a night bus from Jammu to
Srinagar. While the ride was supposed to take about 12 hours it took in
fact 16 due to two punctures, and a driver deciding to sleep it off
instead. Unfortunately for him the police didn't agree with him and put
him to work. The ride turned out to be really nice, with amazing views
and nice discussions.</p>
<p>In Srinagar I spend only a couple of days. Somehow the city didn't
appeal to me. I think it was because it is way too touristic without
offering me any reasons to stay. So, after Srinagar I took the amazing
two-day bus ride to Leh, Ladakh! Amazing views, and nice dangerous small
roads. Awesome road.</p>
<p>Ladakh is beautiful. Certain locations are simply stunning. It is a pity
though that all the valleys are full of military bases. This does
destroy some of the immersion. It's also unfortunate that Leh has been
growing so much; big concrete hotels are appearing everywhere and they
simply don't fit in. Since I had quite some work left on my thesis I
wasn't able to explore much of Ladakh but I will definitely come back
here for trekking, or maybe some teaching? We'll see!</p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>In my previous post I wrote how few foreign tourists could be found in
Shimla. Well, I've spend some weeks now here in McLeod Ganj, and I &nbsp;can
tell you it's quite the opposite. You really have to look hard to find
Indian people around here! Okay, they're still here, but seem to be a
minority compared to the huge amounts of Tibetan people and foreign
tourists.</p>
<p>Anyhow, let's continue where I finished last time. I spend quite some
time in Shimla, and during my stay I met again some travelers I met
before in Udaipur and Jodhpur, which was quite nice. Unlike me they have
been to many more places since we split ways so it was very nice to
catch up and hear their stories of their travels. It was actually the
last day for me in Shimla when I met two Canadians I had met before in
Jodhpur. While they decided to spend Holi in Shimla I went back to
Delhi.</p>
<p>So....Delhi and Holi. Quite some people are afraid of this combination,
but I must say there is no reason at all. While it can get chaotic
(drunk rickshaw drivers doing tricks on their rickshaws, waterballoons
coming at you from all directions), it is a VERY nice and colourful day!
I had a great day and stay there and look forward to a next Holi :-)</p>
<p>Some days after Holi I took the bus again, and this time to Dharamsala
or more precise, McLeod Ganj. McLeod Ganj is the area where the Tibetan
government in exile can be found and as such many Tibetan refugees live
here. Many foreigners could also be found due to popularity of the Dalai
Lama and Tibetan&nbsp;Buddhism. While I am one of the foreigners here I must
say I am definitely not here for this reason. Most foreigners that I met
here in McLeod Ganj come to learn about that culture, for meditation or
to smoke.</p>
<p>Again I met some travelers from before here, which was nice to spend
some time with again. By now though they've all left, and so I feel it's
time to move on again as well. As I've been working real hard on my
thesis again for a while (except last week due to a stupid injury) I
feel like having a short break again. Therefore my plan is to go to
Dalhousie for a dat or two, departing at the end of the weekend. After
that I continue my plans by heading to Srinagar. I haven't figured out
yet whether I go there via Udhampur or Jammu. While I don't want to go
via the latter I am told it is easiest to go from there. Hmmm, I'll have
to think about it. Maybe when I go up Triund again and spend the night
at the Snowline Cafe?</p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>During my previous post I already wrote that I arrived in Jodhpur, how
amazing the guesthouse was and that I went to see an Indian doctor. The
medication did its work and after some days I was feeling good again,
and ready to explore the town!</p>

<p>Jodhpur has a nice bazaar around the clocktower. Here one can also find
excellent lassis which are actually quite a bit different from the other
lassies I had so far. A lassi is a drink that consists of yogurt mixed
with water and spices. Normally one drinks a lassi but this one is quite
a bit thicker, requiring the use of a spoon. It also had a strong lemon
taste to it.</p>

<p class="caption">The fortress entrance</p>

<p>The main attraction of Jodhpur is the fortress. Located on a hill it is
beautiful to see. The fortress also offers amazing views over the new
and the old, blue city. In this case I think pictures say more than
words :-)</p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Two and a half weeks ago I arrived in Delhi. Since then I went to Agra,
Jaipur, and Jodhpur, where I decided to stay some longer. Let's try and
keep it chronological, and start with Agra.</p>
<p><img alt="Taj Mahal" src="/images/2013/02/IMG_0128-300x225.jpg"></p>
<p>I was in Agra for I think 5 nights, and the location I was staying, Saj
Palace, was quite nice. There were plenty small restaurants and shops
around, and the hotel had a nice view on the Taj. People came and went,
but like me, there was a Canadian family staying a bit longer. They were
actually on a world trip of a whopping 14 months! Anyhow, in Agra I
finally was able to do some work on my thesis as well.</p>
<p><img alt="Agra Fort" src="/images/2013/02/IMG_0130-300x225.jpg"></p>
<p>After Agra I went by train to Jaipur during which I had a nice
conversation with a local. She was having a puppy along, and, as long as
the other people in the coach wouldn't mind, according to the rules the
dog should be allowed to stay. Well, I was the only other one, and I
didn't mind at all, but somehow the conductor didn't agree and sent the
dog to a special coach. So stupid...</p>
<p>Anyhow, Jaipur. I don't have much positive to say about my stay there.
While the hotel had friendly personnel and the rooms were quite good, it
was so damn noisy I couldn't get any sleep at all. And when you then get
diarrhea as well...pfff. But before I got that I did get to see some of
the town, but there wasn't anything special in my opinion, and therefore
I wouldn't recommend anyone to go there.</p>
<p><img alt="Old city of Jaipur" src="/images/2013/02/IMG_0156-300x225.jpg"></p>
<p>Because of the diarrhea and fever I stayed a bit longer in Jaipur.
Eventually I decided to go to Jodhpur even though I was still sick. The
train ride from Jaipur to Jodhpur was I think the best moment I've had
during my stay here. I booked a ticket for an AC3 coach, but wasn't able
to find it as all the numbers were messed up when it arrived. I went
instead in a normal sleeper class. The smell at first was horrible, but
after a few minutes you're used to it. I put my stuff away,  lay down on
a berth, in the sun shine, with the windows open the wind going through
the coach. It was great! In the meanwhile, cracking some nuts and
talking to some locals. Best moment so far :)</p>
<p>In Jodhpor I am now staying at a great hotel. The people that are
working here are very friendly, the food is the best I had thus far, and
it's quiet! Like me there are quite some others here who are traveling
for more than four months through India. Some are going from north to
south, while others went south first. It's interesting to hear where
they've been, and what they thought of the places, as I also haven't
decided where I will be going.</p>
<p>Two days ago I went to see a doctor and got some medication for the
diarrhea and fever. I think I got it because I drank half a glass of tap
water. Stupid. Things seem to be improving now, though the antibiotics
are making me so tired, that I haven't been able to explore Jodhpur yet.
As I will be staying for a least another 5 days in Jodhpur, that
shouldn't be a problem though. After those five days I will take the
train to Jaisalmer where I would like to go on a 2 or 3 day camel
safari.</p> </div><!-- /.entry-content -->
