                <div class="entry-content"> <p>When listening to an aircraft flying over, you can hear that the level
and spectral contents fluctuate somewhat. These fluctuations are due to
turbulence in the atmosphere, affecting the sound generation (variable
load on engines) and the sound propagation. In order to create a
plausible auralisation of aircraft noise these fluctuations have to be
accounted for.</p>
<p>Turbulent flow can be modeled as a superposition of a spectrum of
fluctuations and eddies upon a mean flow.&nbsp;A common approach for noise
predictions methods to include the effects of atmospheric turbulence is
to use a statistical approach; generate many random 'frozen' turbulence
fields, calculate for each of these how sound propagates through them
and then average your results. The 'frozen' fields represent snapshots
in time of how the atmosphere could look like. These snapshots are
calculated based on a spectrum of fluctuations. Well known descriptions
of these spectra are the Gaussian and von Karman spectra.</p>
<p>The figure belows shows a portion of two turbulence spectra.</p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>When two waves are superimposed on each other it is possible that the
resultant wave has a higher or lower amplitude at certain moments in
time. This phenomenon is called interference. One classical experiment
related to interference is Lloyd's mirror.&nbsp;In the classical experiment,
light from a&nbsp;monochromatic&nbsp;slit source&nbsp;reflects&nbsp;from a glass surface at
a small angle.&nbsp;The reflected light then interferes with the direct light
from the source, forming&nbsp;interference&nbsp;fringes. This pattern is called
Lloyd's mirror effect.</p>
<p>In the classical experiment light is used but the same result can be
obtained using sound waves. When a sound wave is reflected from a
surface the reflected sound wave will also interfere with the direct
sound wave. This phenomenon can also be experienced with aircraft noise
due to the ground reflection. However, because an aircraft generally
(hopefully?) moves in the sky, the interference pattern changes over the
time.</p>
<p>Today I managed to include this effect in my aircraft auralisation
tool.&nbsp;The figure below shows a spectrogram of a synthesized aircraft
passage. In the spectrogram the Doppler shift can be seen as well as
many curves which represent interference fringes, the Lloyd's mirror
effect. The mirror effect is in this case solely due to the ground. Now,
since my implementation supports reflections from buildings as well, the
effect will also be obtained due to these reflections from facades,
although far less pronounced.</p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Last week was the first winterschool of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.fp7sonorus.eu/">SONORUS project</a>&nbsp;as well
as a Network Meeting and this was also the first time for us, ESR's, to
meet each other and all other partners involved in this project. SONORUS
is an Initial Training Network under the FP7 People Programme in the
field of Urban Sound Planning, aiming at improving the acoustic
environment of our cities in a holistic approach. In the project, 14
young researchers (ESR's) work together on improving the soundscape of
several cities in conjunction with their individual research projects.</p>
<p>On Sunday evening prior to the winterschool there was a dinner for all
those involved in the project, a very pleasant way to get to know each
other. On Monday morning the Network Meeting began. An introduction to
the project was given by the project leader and the research partners
also presented themselves. Juergen Bauer of WIT then gave a talk named
'Urban sound planning in the bigger context' stressing the importance of
Urban Sound Planning. That afternoon the ESR's presented themselves as
well as the involved city partners showing their cases.</p>
<p>Tuesday morning the winterschool truly began. From then on every day was
packed with lectures and workshops. The winterschool dealt with urban
sound propagation and therefore sound propagation and modelling
technique were extensively discussed along with standard methods and the
European Noise Directive. The winterschool was concluded on Friday with
a small exam.</p>
<p>A topic that briefly passed by during a presentation of Timothy van
Renterghem seemed to have impressed me quite a bit. He briefly showed
the results from his research on the importance of rooftops for road
traffic noise shielding. Basically, the shape of a rooftop can have
great influence on how much sound is diffracted and thus how quiet a
courtyard could potentially become.</p>

<p class="caption">The importance of roof shape for road traffic
noise shielding in the urban environment environment, T. Van Renterghem
et al., Journal of Sound and Vibration, 2010.[/caption]</p>
</div>
<p>The Tuesday afternoon we had an initial look together at the test cases
and groups were formed to see how they would tackle the problems that
were presented. Each group discussed a single test site and concluded
the session with a presentation about their initial impressions of the
challenge at hand.</p>
<p>Right from the start of this week project members started discussing
their work and how they might cooperate. Thursday after the lectures I
gave a short presentation on tools for collaboration resulting in a
brief discussion on the topic. While we were all too tired to go into
the details at the time my general impression was that the&nbsp;consensus&nbsp;was
that we should definitely look deeper into these kind of tools.</p>
<p>All in all I think this meeting was quite fruitful and I'm looking
forward to the next time!</p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Almost two months ago I started working at the Swiss research institute
Empa in Dübendorf, Switzerland, as part of a European Seventh Framework
project called <a class="reference external" href="http://www.fp7sonorus.eu/">Sonorus</a>. The project is about urban sound planning and
my task is to develop an aircraft noise simulator. &nbsp;The first two months
passed really fast. It's a great place to work, and the type of work
really fits me. Obviously I began with reading a bit about the topic and
thinking how I would tackle the issues at hand. But very soon I began
with implementing the first bits and mainly prototyping what I think it
should become.</p>
<p>The idea is that I develop an aircraft noise simulator capable of
simulating how an aircraft pass-by sounds at a stationary receiver while
in an urban environment. This means effects like spherical spreading,
Doppler shift and reflections at the ground and facades have to be
included in the propagation model. But first it is important to obtain a
good time-frequency representation of an aircraft, and obviously these
depend on the make or type of the aircraft as well as the conditions.
Finally, the aircraft noise has to be reproduced using for example an
Ambisonics setup.</p>
<p>Now, there are quite some challenges here and 'unknowns' to be solved .
While I have a good idea of how I will build such a tool for
auralisation, there are many details requiring attention. An example is
how much does turbulence in the atmosphere influence the propagation?
How to simulate decorrelation? How to reproduce correct over-head
information? And quite some more questions that need answering the
coming three years :-)</p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Many that know me are aware of the fact that I am spending this summer
in Oslo, Norway. In May I was offered a position for the summer at the
Noise &amp; Vibration section at <a href="http://www.dnv.com/">Det Norske Veritas</a> in Høvik. Thus far I
am quite content with the work. I've been traveling a lot across Norway
for noise and vibration measurements (DNV Comfort Class) and I've
started working on noise and vibration predictions.</p>
<p>Oslo seems to be a nice city as well. Especially the location where I
live; everything is basically around the corner. Commuting time is
acceptable and nature can be reached in about half an hour.
Unfortunately I haven't really been able to see much of the nature
outside Oslo due to the bad weather and a bad fever last week.</p>
<p>The coming week I am having off from work, and what way to spend it
better than to go hiking! Monday I will take the bus/train to Liomseter
from where I will hike for five days along the final part of
Jotunheimstien. Last week I bought all the gear (ouch, Gore-Tex is
expensive!!) I think I will need for this and future trips. What future
trips, you might ask. Well, at least end of next month I intend to walk
the <a href="Kungsleden: http://www.svenskaturistforeningen.se/en/Discover-Sweden/Facilities-and-activities/Lappland/kingstrail/">Kungsleden</a> in Sweden.</p>
<p>Anyhow, summer thus far has been quite nice with visiting The
Netherlands again, as well as attending <a href="http://www.hultsfredsfestivalen.se/">Hultsfredsfestivalen</a> in
Sweden. And with the forecast of the hiking trips it only seems to
become better :-)</p>
<p>To end this post I have here a nice recording of the Norwegian band
Katzenjammer, who were playing at Hultsfredsfestivalen as well, though
this is a recording from elsewhere.</p>
