Title: mdwiki: a Wiki using Markdown

Some time ago I encountered
[mdwiki](http://dynalon.github.io/mdwiki/#!index.md), a Wiki which is
processed entirely client-side. In short:

1.  Download `mdwiki.html`, put it in the root of your site, and rename
    it to `index.html`
2.  Add `index.md` which you use as your index page. Write content in
    your favorite formatting syntax, Markdown :-)
3.  Optionally add a
    [`navigation.md`](http://dynalon.github.io/mdwiki/#!quickstart.md#Adding_a_navigation)
    for a navigation bar.
4.  Add any other Markdown file.

It doesn't have many features but in my opinion it doesn't have to. It's
great for quickly publishing ideas or content without bothering too much
yet with layout and looks. Now, that doesn't mean it's not possible to
make nice looking sites as can be seen in the
[examples](http://dynalon.github.io/mdwiki/#!examples.md). Also, features
can be added using
[gimmicks](http://dynalon.github.io/mdwiki/#!gimmicks.md). Examples of
added functionality are the parsing of equations, embedding Google Maps
and YouTube video's.
