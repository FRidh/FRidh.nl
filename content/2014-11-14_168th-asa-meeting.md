Title: 168th ASA meeting
Date: 2014-11-21

Several weeks ago I was in Indianapolis for the [168th ASA meeting](http://acousticalsociety.org/content/fall-2014-meeting). The main reason
for me to go to this conference was to meet fellow [VASTCON](http://vastcon.wordpress.com) members.

The conference was quite a bit different from the one I attended in 
[Krakow]({filename}/2014-09-14_forum-acusticum-2014.md). There were spaces 
available that one could work, including internet connectivity, and the chairs 
were actually comfortable. Basically every evening there were activities, 
ranging from a visit to a museum to a Halloween party. While the conference was 
small there were some interesting special sessions, like the session on hot 
topics in acoustics and the session on acoustics and education. From the 
technical sessions I especially liked the session on meta-materials and sonic 
crystals.

Thursday morning there was a VASTCON meeting and in the afternoon was the 
VASTCON-organized session on virtual acoustics. During this session I gave a 
presentation on how to include the effects of turbulence on sound propagation 
for auralization of aircraft noise.

On Friday me and some others of VASTCON visited the [Herrick Labs](https://engineering.purdue.edu/Herrick) at Purdue University. There they 
had a very interesting device they used to measure the noise from a rolling 
tyre. The device is basically a circularly shaped road with two wheels on arms 
rotating rapidly moving over the road.

After a (very) short stay in The Netherlands I'm in Gothenburg again at Chalmers.
Strange to be there again!
