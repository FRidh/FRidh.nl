Title: Publishing data: ZENODO and figshare
Date: 2014-11-21

Searching for a way to publish scientific data I found two interesting 
platforms: [figshare](http://figshare.com) and [ZENODO](http://zenodo.org).
I've made a [quick comparison](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12664) between 
the two platforms. For me the clear winner is ZENODO.
