In 2009 I had an internship in DGMR and developed an acoustic measuring
system, as I described a bit [here](http://fridh.nl/projects/autonomic-acoustical-measuring-instrument/). After my internship I continued
working on this project. Now an article has appeared about it in
'Technisch Weekblad' and at their [website](http://www.technischweekblad.nl/special-topproject-dgmr-meet-geluid-met-onbemande.91122.lynkx).
