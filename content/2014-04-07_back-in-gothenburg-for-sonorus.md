Title: Back in Gothenburg for SONORUS

Last month I was back in Gothenburg for a week and it was nice! I've
been living in Gothenburg for close to two years and being back there
brought up some good memories. The reason I was there again was that we
had a course for [SONORUS](http://www.fp7sonorus.eu/) on leadership.

In the course we treated topics like communication, knowledge, coaching,
group dynamics and decision making. There was one very interesting
exercise on group dynamics. In 20 minutes the entire group had to agree
on a list of statements related to meetings. We also [built a
tower](http://www.ted.com/talks/tom_wujec_build_a_tower) using dry
spaghetti, a meter of tape and a marshmallow, or at least we tried!

Besides the course we spent time on some practical matters in the
project, like discussing how we would cooperate, e.g. with regards to
sharing data. Another topic that was discussed is the upcoming
[International Noise Awareness Day](http://www.chchearing.org/noise-center-home/international-noise-awareness-day),
but more about that later!
