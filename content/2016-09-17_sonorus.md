On the 15th and 16th of September the [Urban Sound Planning Symposium](http://www.muellerbbm.com/events/seminars-and-workshops/urban-sound-planning/) took place
at Muller-BBM in Planegg, Germany. This occassion also marked the end of the
SONORUS project. At the symposium we mostly looked back at what we've achieved
these last three years. There was a short poster session and after the event was
over we got our "Urban Sound Planner" certificates. Finally I have something to hang
up next to my shoe-lacing certificate.
