Every other day or so I watch a [TED talk](http://ted.com) and today I
saw a
[talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_anholt_which_country_does_the_most_good_for_the_world?language=en)
by Simon Anholt titled *Which country does the most good for the
world?*.

Policy advisor Simon Anholt thought of a new scale describing how much
good a country does outside its borders, and it's called *[The Good
Country Index](http://goodcountry.org/)*. In his talk he discusses why
countries tend to compete instead of cooperate, why this should change
and how this could be changed. He investigated how people perceive other
countries and he found out that the countries we like are the *good*
countries. Good countries, what do I mean with that you might wonder.
Well, if you want to have an answer on that I suggest watching the talk!
