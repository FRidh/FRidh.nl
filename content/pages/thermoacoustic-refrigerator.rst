From February to June 2010 I worked on a project at SP Technical
Research Institute involving thermoacoustics. Goal was to produce a
thermoacoustic refrigerator delivering 100 watts of cooling power at 280
K using heat. A basic introduction to thermoacoustics can be found at
`Wikipedia`_ `here`_ and
`here <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoacoustic_hot_air_engine>`__.
Recently I have been adding pieces of information about thermoacoustics,
and I intend to do more.

`Here you can find my final report`_ that I wrote as part of my bachelor
thesis. Note that there are some mistakes in it, of which one I
completely missed during my checks (hint: it has to do with with
harmonics and length of a device).

The following is an abstract of my report:

    Thermoacoustics is a field that combines thermodynamics, fluid
    dynamics and acoustics. In thermoacoustics it is possible to
    construct thermodynamic engines, prime movers and heat pumps which
    respectively use heat to create work, and use work to create or move
    heat.

    Thermoacoustics is a relatively new field of science and
    engineering. The subject is still quite unknown and not much
    literature about the subject is available. But there is a positive
    trend in the amount of published papers about the subject.

    There are two classes of thermoacoustic devices, travelling-wave
    devices and standing-wave devices. The first use a standard
    travelling acoustic wave and the second use a resonator in which the
    acoustic waves interfere causing a standing-wave.

    The goal of this project was to develop a standing-wave
    thermoacoustic refrigerator. The refrigerator should be able to
    deliver 100 Watts of cooling power at 280 Kelvin. The device should
    be at most one meter long.

    This report gives an introduction in thermoacoustics, and a summary
    of a paper by Greg Swift called ‘Thermoacoustic engines’. The
    different parts of a thermoacoustic device with their properties are
    discussed as well.

    Several simple devices have been constructed during the project and
    these are discussed. Not all of these devices worked though. The
    model of the final refrigerator is presented as well. Because of
    lack of time and technical difficulties the final device was not
    constructed.
