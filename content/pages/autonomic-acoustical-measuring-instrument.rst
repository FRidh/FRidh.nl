During my internship I worked on an autonomic acoustical measuring
instrument. The measuring instrument is capable of using measured sound
power levels to determine sound power levels of the source, and by using
those sound power levels capable of verifying the circuits' permits.

Because it is an entirely automated measuring instrument, it should be
capable of measuring accurate. This means the instrument needs to
determine whether the measurement is accurate, and whether it is
justified to draw certain conclusions based on input. Factors that
determine the accuracy are weather conditions and noise like aircraft,
local noise and activity on a nearby circuit. The permits are given per
circuit thus the measuring instrument should be able to test the permit
ofÂ  each circuit.

The automated measuring instrument calculates sound power levels of the
sources and theoretical immissions based on measured sound power levels.
Additionally the calculation unit determines the accuracy of the
measurement. The calculation unit can be thought of as the heart of the
measuring instrument.

Besides the measuring instrument I developed software to show the
expected sound pressure levels in an area caused by the determined
noises.
