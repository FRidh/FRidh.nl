Title: SONORUS: Urban Sound Planner
Status: hidden

Since the summer of 2014 I am working at the Swiss Federal Laboratories for 
Materials Science and Technology, more commonly known as [Empa](http://empa.ch). 
I am employed as an Early Stage Researcher within the [SONORUS](http://fp7sonorus.eu) project.

SONORUS is an Initial Training Network and it's goal is to educate future Urban 
Sound Planners.
