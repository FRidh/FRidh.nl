Title: Auralisation of aircraft noise
Status: hidden

Since the summer of 2014 I am working at the Swiss Federal Laboratories for 
Materials Science and Technology, more commonly known as Empa. For three years I 
will work within the [SONORUS]({filename}/pages/sonorus-urban-sound-planner.md) project to develop a tool for the auralisation of 
aircraft noise.
