Intro
=====

My name is Frederik Rietdijk and I'm a PhD student in acoustics. Some of my 
interests are hiking, climbing and writing software. I'm especially interested 
in how technology affects us all and how we can utilise it to become more 
effective.

As said I'm a PhD student. While I'm enrolled at Chalmers University of 
Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden, I work in fact in Duebendorf, Switzerland, at the Swiss 
Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, more commonly known 
as Empa.

History
=======

Born in Rotterdam, and raised in Goudswaard. In Goudswaard I went to
primary school, `De Gouwaert`_. After primary education I went to high
school in Oud-Beijerland, `RSG de Hoefsmid`_, where I finished havo. In
2005 I began studies in Engineering Physics at the Technische Hogeschool
Rijswijk, nowadays `The Hague University`_, location Delft. In 2006 I
moved to The Hague.\

    Several of the older houses in Goudswaard.

During my study I took part in several committees, the most important
being as Chairman of the `Study Association Angstrom`_. To make a living
I was working part-time at Mediamarkt The Hague until my first studies
related internship, which was at `DGMR`_, a consultancy company. After
the internship I worked there both part-time during the summer, as well
as part-time next to my studies.\

    City center of The Hague.
    
In February 2010 I finished my final semester, indicating it was time to
start writing my thesis. I decided to write my thesis abroad and this
decision took me to Sweden. For four months I was working on my thesis
at \ `SP Technical Research Institute`_. During this period I lived in a
big student dorm called Balder, in the small city of Borås nearby
Gothenburg. It was also during this period that I realized I wanted to
remain in Sweden, and continue studies in Gothenburg as well.

    Center of the small city Borås.

In June 2010 I finished my Engineering Physics study, giving me the
international title of Bachelor of Engineering (B Eng), or the Dutch
Ingenieur (Ing.). Unfortunately the application deadline for the study
had passed and I wasn't able to remain in Sweden. I moved back to Sweden
and began working full-time at DGMR, with the intention of returning to
Sweden the next year. Back in The Hague I lived in the tallest tower of
the city, called 'Het Strijkijzer'.

    The tower I was living in for a year.

During spring 2011 it was clear I was definitely returning to Sweden and
in July I moved to Gothenburg, where I lived in a huge student area
called Olofshöjd. In August 2011 I began with the master program Sound &
Vibration at `Chalmers University of Technology`_.

For the summer of 2012 I got the great opportunity to work at `Det
Norske Veritas`_ in Oslo, Norway. At first I was a bit skeptical towards
moving away from Gothenburg, but soon I realized I liked it there a lot.
After the summer I moved back to Gothenburg and continued my studies.

During spring 2013 I wrote my master thesis. Ever since I moved to
Sweden I planned I would go to another country again for the thesis.
Just a month before I would begin with the thesis work I decided I would
write my thesis while backpacking through India. This was one amazing
trip.

In August 2013 I moved to Switzerland and began working at `Empa`_ in
Dübendorf, Switzerland.
