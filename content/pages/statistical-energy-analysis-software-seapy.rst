Currently I am working on a Python implementation for Statistical Energy
Analysis or SEA. SEA is used in the field of vibro-acoustics to predict
high-frequent noise and vibration.

The implementation, currently under the name SEApy, consists of a set of
classes with which an SEA model or system can constructed. New SEA
components, subsystems and couplings can quickly be added by simply
deriving the respective base class. Models are currently saved in an
XML-like file format.

Project development is at the time of writing closed but should, as soon
as the code enters a more stable state, be opened entirely.
