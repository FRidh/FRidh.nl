As posted earlier I've been [uploading to Zenodo]({static}2014-11-21_posters-and-slides-about-my-project.md) almost all slides, posters and proceedings that I made during my project.
This includes the [slides](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16405) (as well as two auralizations) of the [presentation](http://dx.doi.org/10.1121/1.4900268) I gave at the 168th ASA meeting in Indianapolis last year.
