During my previous post I already wrote that I arrived in Jodhpur, how
amazing the guesthouse was and that I went to see an Indian doctor. The
medication did its work and after some days I was feeling good again,
and ready to explore the town!

    The fortress

Jodhpur has a nice bazaar around the clocktower. Here one can also find
excellent lassis which are actually quite a bit different from the other
lassies I had so far. A lassi is a drink that consists of yogurt mixed
with water and spices. Normally one drinks a lassi but this one is quite
a bit thicker, requiring the use of a spoon. It also had a strong lemon
taste to it.

    The fortress entrance
    
The main attraction of Jodhpur is the fortress. Located on a hill it is
beautiful to see. The fortress also offers amazing views over the new
and the old, blue city. In this case I think pictures say more than
words :-)

    The blue city and a flock of pigeons that can always be found at the fort.
