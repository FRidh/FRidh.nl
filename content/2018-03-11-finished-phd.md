Back in September, I
[defended](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/ace/calendar/Pages/Frederik-
Rietdijk.aspx) my PhD thesis. The PDF can be
[found](http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/251306/251306.pdf)
in the Chalmers library. Furthermore, I made available a
[routine](https://github.com/FRidh/phd_thesis) to build the PDF from source,
including the majority of the simulations. This is done using the [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/nix/).
