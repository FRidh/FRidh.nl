Recently I set up a new [Planet] aimed at acousticians called 
[Planet Acoustics]. A Planet is basically a [feed] reader; it downloads news feeds 
published by web sites and aggregates their content together into a single 
combined feed. The purpose of this Planet is to collect blogs and news by and 
for acousticians.

Planets are very popular in the open-source software development world. Planets 
like [Planet KDE], [Planet Debian], [Planet Python] and [Planet SciPy] syndicate 
posts from many people all over the world who write posts related to 
respectively [KDE], the [Debian] project, [Python] programming language and the 
Python module [SciPy].

The posts on such a Planet give a good overview of which efforts are currently 
taking place. Contrary to news posts, press releases or journal articles they 
are informal. People write about their current work, problems they face, events 
they attend and often share nice tips and tricks or even detailed tutorials.

I hope that [Planet Acoustics] will become a Planet with many nice posts regarding acoustics and the life of acousticians.
If you would like to have your posts syndicated, then please send an e-mail to <admin@planetacoustics.org> with your name and a link to your [Atom] or [RSS] feed.
Hopefully, in time, Planet Acoustics will become just as successfull as those Planets I referred to :-)
