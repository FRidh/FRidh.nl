Last year I saw [this TED talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/erik_brynjolfsson_the_key_to_growth_race_em_with_em_the_machines)
by [Erik Brynjolfsson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Brynjolfsson)
on how we should handle the digital revolution. In 2011 he wrote *Race
Against the Machine* together with [Andrew McAfee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McAfee) and last week I
finally got to reading it (okay I admit, I completely forgot it was on
my to read list). It's a good book and I strongly recommend it. The
digital revolution is happening, things are changing and a lot of people
can't keep up with it. Next up, *The Second Machine Age*, another book
by Brynjolfsson and McAfee.
