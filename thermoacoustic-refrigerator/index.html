    <h1>Thermoacoustic refrigerator</h1>
    

    <p>From February to June 2010 I worked on a project at SP Technical
Research Institute involving thermoacoustics. Goal was to produce a
thermoacoustic refrigerator delivering 100 watts of cooling power at 280
K using heat. A basic introduction to thermoacoustics can be found at
<a class="reference external" href="http://wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoacoustics">here</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoacoustic_hot_air_engine">here</a>.
Recently I have been adding pieces of information about thermoacoustics,
and I intend to do more.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://fridh.nl/wp-content/2010/09/2010-06-01_report_final.pdf">Here you can find my final report</a> that I wrote as part of my bachelor
thesis. Note that there are some mistakes in it, of which one I
completely missed during my checks (hint: it has to do with with
harmonics and length of a device).</p>
<p>The following is an abstract of my report:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thermoacoustics is a field that combines thermodynamics, fluid
dynamics and acoustics. In thermoacoustics it is possible to
construct thermodynamic engines, prime movers and heat pumps which
respectively use heat to create work, and use work to create or move
heat.</p>
<p>Thermoacoustics is a relatively new field of science and
engineering. The subject is still quite unknown and not much
literature about the subject is available. But there is a positive
trend in the amount of published papers about the subject.</p>
<p>There are two classes of thermoacoustic devices, travelling-wave
devices and standing-wave devices. The first use a standard
travelling acoustic wave and the second use a resonator in which the
acoustic waves interfere causing a standing-wave.</p>
<p>The goal of this project was to develop a standing-wave
thermoacoustic refrigerator. The refrigerator should be able to
deliver 100 Watts of cooling power at 280 Kelvin. The device should
be at most one meter long.</p>
<p>This report gives an introduction in thermoacoustics, and a summary
of a paper by Greg Swift called ‘Thermoacoustic engines’. The
different parts of a thermoacoustic device with their properties are
discussed as well.</p>
<p>Several simple devices have been constructed during the project and
these are discussed. Not all of these devices worked though. The
model of the final refrigerator is presented as well. Because of
lack of time and technical difficulties the final device was not
constructed.</p>
