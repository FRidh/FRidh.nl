    <p>The headquarters of the Swiss Air Force is located in Duebendorf, and the 
airstrip of the base is not that far from where I work. Often you can see 
paratroopers and helicopters or hear other aircraft take off. </p>
<p>Occasionally, one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Air_Force#Air_demonstration_teams">demonstration teams</a> practices.
So far I've only seen the PC-7 Team, which use Swiss-manufactered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilatus_PC-7">Pilatus PC-7</a> turbo prop trainers.
These aircraft can be quite noisy. Actually, it's not that the sound is very loud, it's just that the sound can be 
annoying. The propellors have a strong directivity and therefore, as they do their maneuvers, the level goes up and down.</p>
<p>They don't practice that often, and their sessions generally don't last more 
than a couple of hours. Therefore, I can't really be bothered too much by it. 
If I hear them, and it bothers me, I just close my window or turn the music up a 
bit. But what astonishes me is that they actually do these activities above 
dense populated areas. Many people are living and working in the area. What if 
an accident occurs? </p>
<p>I realize there aren't many places in Switzerland where they could build 
airstrips and do this kind of training without flying over someone's home. But 
flying over a dense area like this or flying over one or two farms is quite a 
difference. I am curious now to their risk assessment and how they've 
eventually decided to keep doing these activities here.</p>
<p>To conclude, these activities can be noisy, and perhaps also dangerous. 
However, on a more positive note, they also provide good entertainment during your break!</p>
