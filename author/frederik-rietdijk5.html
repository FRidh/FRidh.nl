                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Many that know me are aware of the fact that I am spending this summer
in Oslo, Norway. In May I was offered a position for the summer at the
Noise &amp; Vibration section at <a href="http://www.dnv.com/">Det Norske Veritas</a> in HÃ¸vik. Thus far I
am quite content with the work. I've been traveling a lot across Norway
for noise and vibration measurements (DNV Comfort Class) and I've
started working on noise and vibration predictions.</p>
<p>Oslo seems to be a nice city as well. Especially the location where I
live; everything is basically around the corner. Commuting time is
acceptable and nature can be reached in about half an hour.
Unfortunately I haven't really been able to see much of the nature
outside Oslo due to the bad weather and a bad fever last week.</p>
<p>The coming week I am having off from work, and what way to spend it
better than to go hiking! Monday I will take the bus/train to Liomseter
from where I will hike for five days along the final part of
Jotunheimstien. Last week I bought all the gear (ouch, Gore-Tex is
expensive!!) I think I will need for this and future trips. What future
trips, you might ask. Well, at least end of next month I intend to walk
the <a href="Kungsleden: http://www.svenskaturistforeningen.se/en/Discover-Sweden/Facilities-and-activities/Lappland/kingstrail/">Kungsleden</a> in Sweden.</p>
<p>Anyhow, summer thus far has been quite nice with visiting The
Netherlands again, as well as attending <a href="http://www.hultsfredsfestivalen.se/">Hultsfredsfestivalen</a> in
Sweden. And with the forecast of the hiking trips it only seems to
become better :-)</p>
<p>To end this post I have here a nice recording of the Norwegian band
Katzenjammer, who were playing at Hultsfredsfestivalen as well, though
this is a recording from elsewhere.</p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>In 2009 I had an internship in DGMR and developed an acoustic measuring
system, as I described a bit <a href="http://fridh.nl/projects/autonomic-acoustical-measuring-instrument/">here</a>. After my internship I continued
working on this project. Now an article has appeared about it in
'Technisch Weekblad' and at their <a href="http://www.technischweekblad.nl/special-topproject-dgmr-meet-geluid-met-onbemande.91122.lynkx">website</a>.</p> </div><!-- /.entry-content -->
