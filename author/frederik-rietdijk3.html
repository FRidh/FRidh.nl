                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Every other day or so I watch a <a href="http://ted.com">TED talk</a> and today I
saw a
<a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_anholt_which_country_does_the_most_good_for_the_world?language=en">talk</a>
by Simon Anholt titled <em>Which country does the most good for the
world?</em>.</p>
<p>Policy advisor Simon Anholt thought of a new scale describing how much
good a country does outside its borders, and it's called <em><a href="http://goodcountry.org/">The Good
Country Index</a></em>. In his talk he discusses why
countries tend to compete instead of cooperate, why this should change
and how this could be changed. He investigated how people perceive other
countries and he found out that the countries we like are the <em>good</em>
countries. Good countries, what do I mean with that you might wonder.
Well, if you want to have an answer on that I suggest watching the talk!</p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Some time ago I encountered
<a href="http://dynalon.github.io/mdwiki/#!index.md">mdwiki</a>, a Wiki which is
processed entirely client-side. In short:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download <code>mdwiki.html</code>, put it in the root of your site, and rename
    it to <code>index.html</code></li>
<li>Add <code>index.md</code> which you use as your index page. Write content in
    your favorite formatting syntax, Markdown :-)</li>
<li>Optionally add a
    <a href="http://dynalon.github.io/mdwiki/#!quickstart.md#Adding_a_navigation"><code>navigation.md</code></a>
    for a navigation bar.</li>
<li>Add any other Markdown file.</li>
</ol>
<p>It doesn't have many features but in my opinion it doesn't have to. It's
great for quickly publishing ideas or content without bothering too much
yet with layout and looks. Now, that doesn't mean it's not possible to
make nice looking sites as can be seen in the
<a href="http://dynalon.github.io/mdwiki/#!examples.md">examples</a>. Also, features
can be added using
<a href="http://dynalon.github.io/mdwiki/#!gimmicks.md">gimmicks</a>. Examples of
added functionality are the parsing of equations, embedding Google Maps
and YouTube video's.</p> </div><!-- /.entry-content -->

on how we should handle the digital revolution. In 2011 he wrote <em>Race
Against the Machine</em> together with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McAfee">Andrew McAfee</a> and last week I
finally got to reading it (okay I admit, I completely forgot it was on
my to read list). It's a good book and I strongly recommend it. The
digital revolution is happening, things are changing and a lot of people
can't keep up with it. Next up, <em>The Second Machine Age</em>, another book
by Brynjolfsson and McAfee.</p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Last week the conference <a href="http://fa2014.pl">Forum Acusticum 2014</a> took
place in the city of Krakow, Poland. From Monday till Friday there were
presentations as well as meetings of technical committees. The
presentations covered a wide range of topics like structural acoustics,
human response and auralisation.</p>
<p>A special session was organised on Urban Sound Planning as well, in
which many of my <a href="http://www.fp7sonorus.eu/">project members</a> presented
their current work. I'm glad a lot of people attended the session.</p>
<p>I gave a presentation with the title <em>Modelling sound propagation in the
presence of turbulence for the auralisation of aircraft noise</em> in a
session on Environmental Acoustics. This session was Friday morning
early, which was a bit unfortunate, considering there was a nice party
with the <a href="https://www.euracoustics.org/activities/yan">Young Acousticians Network</a> the evening
before. I was surprised there were still so many people that morning!</p>
<p>On Thursday I joined a discussion on benchmarking for computational
acoustics. When implementing a model you would like to be able to
validate this. This can sometimes be difficult due to lack of available
information or benchmarks. Therefore, the idea is now to put online some
kind of repository where people can put their benchmarks. Considering
this is a topic of interest in other fields of science I am really
curious how they deal with this.</p>
<p>The city of Krakow surprised me a lot. It's quite a green city and there
seems to be a good and relaxed mood. There's plenty of pubs and
restaurants, especially around the main square which is huge.</p>
<p>Anyway, that's my summary on FA2014!</p> </div><!-- /.entry-content -->

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Last month I was back in Gothenburg for a week and it was nice! I've
been living in Gothenburg for close to two years and being back there
brought up some good memories. The reason I was there again was that we
had a course for <a href="http://www.fp7sonorus.eu/">SONORUS</a> on leadership.</p>
<p>In the course we treated topics like communication, knowledge, coaching,
group dynamics and decision making. There was one very interesting
exercise on group dynamics. In 20 minutes the entire group had to agree
on a list of statements related to meetings. We also <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/tom_wujec_build_a_tower">built a
tower</a> using dry
spaghetti, a meter of tape and a marshmallow, or at least we tried!</p>
<p>Besides the course we spent time on some practical matters in the
project, like discussing how we would cooperate, e.g. with regards to
sharing data. Another topic that was discussed is the upcoming
<a href="http://www.chchearing.org/noise-center-home/international-noise-awareness-day">International Noise Awareness Day</a>,
but more about that later!</p> </div><!-- /.entry-content -->

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Numpy offers dense arrays and both <a href="http://www.numpy.org/">Numpy</a> and
<a href="http://scipy.org/">Scipy</a> offer sparse matrices. However, they don't
offer any sparse array solution. On the web I found some implementations
of sparse arrays but they were generally quite limited:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://launchpad.net/ndsparse">ndsparse</a> operators only support
    scalars</li>
<li><a href="http://www.maths.lth.se/matematiklth/personal/solem/downloads/sparray.py">sparray</a>
    operators only support other sparse arrays</li>
</ul>
<p>What I would like to do is replace in some of my calculations certain
dense arrays with sparse arrays. Numpy compatibility is therefore
important. A first version can be found
<a href="https://github.com/FRidh/sparse">here</a>.</p>
<p>What works?</p>
<ul>
<li>The basic operators work with scalars, sparse arrays and dense
    arrays.</li>
<li>Basic slicing is partially supported. newaxis, None, slice and
    Ellipsis aren't really supported yet.</li>
<li>Converting from dense to sparse and vice versa</li>
</ul>
<p>What's left to do?</p>
<ul>
<li>Finish basic slicing</li>
<li>In-place operators</li>
<li>Advanced slicing</li>
<li>Enforcing dtype</li>
<li>Cythonize</li>
</ul>
<p>Because I was curious I Cythonized it quickly. While it is much much
faster than the plain Python implementation it still is about a factor
1000 slower than dense arrays when operatoring with a dense array.
Unfortunately this is too slow for my use case, so for now I reverted to
using dense arrays but with a reduced model size. Nevertheless I am sure
there is a significant performance increase possible.</p> </div><!-- /.entry-content -->

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Recently I set up a new <a href="http://planetplanet.org">Planet</a> aimed at acousticians called 
<a href="http://planetacoustics.org">Planet Acoustics</a>. A Planet is basically a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_syndication">feed</a> reader; it downloads news feeds 
published by web sites and aggregates their content together into a single 
combined feed. The purpose of this Planet is to collect blogs and news by and 
for acousticians.</p>
<p>Planets are very popular in the open-source software development world. Planets 
like <a href="http://planetkde.org">Planet KDE</a>, <a href="http://planet.debian.org">Planet Debian</a>, <a href="http://planet.python.org">Planet Python</a> and <a href="http://planet.scipy.org">Planet SciPy</a> syndicate 
posts from many people all over the world who write posts related to 
respectively <a href="http://kde.org">KDE</a>, the <a href="http://debian.org">Debian</a> project, <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> programming language and the 
Python module <a href="http://scipy.org">SciPy</a>.</p>
<p>The posts on such a Planet give a good overview of which efforts are currently 
taking place. Contrary to news posts, press releases or journal articles they 
are informal. People write about their current work, problems they face, events 
they attend and often share nice tips and tricks or even detailed tutorials.</p>
<p>I hope that <a href="http://planetacoustics.org">Planet Acoustics</a> will become a Planet with many nice posts regarding acoustics and the life of acousticians.
If you would like to have your posts syndicated, then please send an e-mail to <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#97;&#100;&#109;&#105;&#110;&#64;&#112;&#108;&#97;&#110;&#101;&#116;&#97;&#99;&#111;&#117;&#115;&#116;&#105;&#99;&#115;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;">&#97;&#100;&#109;&#105;&#110;&#64;&#112;&#108;&#97;&#110;&#101;&#116;&#97;&#99;&#111;&#117;&#115;&#116;&#105;&#99;&#115;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a> with your name and a link to your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(standard)">Atom</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a> feed.
Hopefully, in time, Planet Acoustics will become just as successfull as those Planets I referred to :-)</p> </div><!-- /.entry-content -->
