    <h1>Statistical Energy Analysis software - SEApy</h1>
    

    <p>Back in 2013 I began working on a Python implementation for Statistical Energy 
Analysis or SEA as part of my master thesis. SEA is used in the field of 
vibro-acoustics to predict high-frequent noise and vibration.</p>
<p>The implementation, named <em>seapy</em>, consists of a set of classes with which an SEA 
model or system can constructed. New SEA components, subsystems and couplings 
can quickly be added by simply subclassing the respective base class. Models can 
be created programmatically or declaratively as a YAML file.</p>
<p>For more information about this project, please check the <a href="https://github.com/FRidh/seapy">repository</a>.</p>
