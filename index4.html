                <div class="entry-content"> <p>When listening to an aircraft flying over, you can hear that the level
and spectral contents fluctuate somewhat. These fluctuations are due to
turbulence in the atmosphere, affecting the sound generation (variable
load on engines) and the sound propagation. In order to create a
plausible auralisation of aircraft noise these fluctuations have to be
accounted for.</p>
<p>Turbulent flow can be modeled as a superposition of a spectrum of
fluctuations and eddies upon a mean flow.&nbsp;A common approach for noise
predictions methods to include the effects of atmospheric turbulence is
to use a statistical approach; generate many random 'frozen' turbulence
fields, calculate for each of these how sound propagates through them
and then average your results. The 'frozen' fields represent snapshots
in time of how the atmosphere could look like. These snapshots are
calculated based on a spectrum of fluctuations. Well known descriptions
of these spectra are the Gaussian and von Karman spectra.</p>
<p>The figure belows shows a portion of two turbulence spectra.</p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>When two waves are superimposed on each other it is possible that the
resultant wave has a higher or lower amplitude at certain moments in
time. This phenomenon is called interference. One classical experiment
related to interference is Lloyd's mirror.&nbsp;In the classical experiment,
light from a&nbsp;monochromatic&nbsp;slit source&nbsp;reflects&nbsp;from a glass surface at
a small angle.&nbsp;The reflected light then interferes with the direct light
from the source, forming&nbsp;interference&nbsp;fringes. This pattern is called
Lloyd's mirror effect.</p>
<p>In the classical experiment light is used but the same result can be
obtained using sound waves. When a sound wave is reflected from a
surface the reflected sound wave will also interfere with the direct
sound wave. This phenomenon can also be experienced with aircraft noise
due to the ground reflection. However, because an aircraft generally
(hopefully?) moves in the sky, the interference pattern changes over the
time.</p>
<p>Today I managed to include this effect in my aircraft auralisation
tool.&nbsp;The figure below shows a spectrogram of a synthesized aircraft
passage. In the spectrogram the Doppler shift can be seen as well as
many curves which represent interference fringes, the Lloyd's mirror
effect. The mirror effect is in this case solely due to the ground. Now,
since my implementation supports reflections from buildings as well, the
effect will also be obtained due to these reflections from facades,
although far less pronounced.</p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Last week was the first winterschool of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.fp7sonorus.eu/">SONORUS project</a>&nbsp;as well
as a Network Meeting and this was also the first time for us, ESR's, to
meet each other and all other partners involved in this project. SONORUS
is an Initial Training Network under the FP7 People Programme in the
field of Urban Sound Planning, aiming at improving the acoustic
environment of our cities in a holistic approach. In the project, 14
young researchers (ESR's) work together on improving the soundscape of
several cities in conjunction with their individual research projects.</p>
<p>On Sunday evening prior to the winterschool there was a dinner for all
those involved in the project, a very pleasant way to get to know each
other. On Monday morning the Network Meeting began. An introduction to
the project was given by the project leader and the research partners
also presented themselves. Juergen Bauer of WIT then gave a talk named
'Urban sound planning in the bigger context' stressing the importance of
Urban Sound Planning. That afternoon the ESR's presented themselves as
well as the involved city partners showing their cases.</p>
<p>Tuesday morning the winterschool truly began. From then on every day was
packed with lectures and workshops. The winterschool dealt with urban
sound propagation and therefore sound propagation and modelling
technique were extensively discussed along with standard methods and the
European Noise Directive. The winterschool was concluded on Friday with
a small exam.</p>
<p>A topic that briefly passed by during a presentation of Timothy van
Renterghem seemed to have impressed me quite a bit. He briefly showed
the results from his research on the importance of rooftops for road
traffic noise shielding. Basically, the shape of a rooftop can have
great influence on how much sound is diffracted and thus how quiet a
courtyard could potentially become.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">

<p class="caption">The importance of roof shape for road traffic
noise shielding in the urban environment environment, T. Van Renterghem
et al., Journal of Sound and Vibration, 2010.[/caption]</p>
</div>
<p>The Tuesday afternoon we had an initial look together at the test cases
and groups were formed to see how they would tackle the problems that
were presented. Each group discussed a single test site and concluded
the session with a presentation about their initial impressions of the
challenge at hand.</p>
<p>Right from the start of this week project members started discussing
their work and how they might cooperate. Thursday after the lectures I
gave a short presentation on tools for collaboration resulting in a
brief discussion on the topic. While we were all too tired to go into
the details at the time my general impression was that the&nbsp;consensus&nbsp;was
that we should definitely look deeper into these kind of tools.</p>
<p>All in all I think this meeting was quite fruitful and I'm looking
forward to the next time!</p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Almost two months ago I started working at the Swiss research institute
Empa in Dübendorf, Switzerland, as part of a European Seventh Framework
project called <a class="reference external" href="http://www.fp7sonorus.eu/">Sonorus</a>. The project is about urban sound planning and
my task is to develop an aircraft noise simulator. &nbsp;The first two months
passed really fast. It's a great place to work, and the type of work
really fits me. Obviously I began with reading a bit about the topic and
thinking how I would tackle the issues at hand. But very soon I began
with implementing the first bits and mainly prototyping what I think it
should become.</p>
<p>The idea is that I develop an aircraft noise simulator capable of
simulating how an aircraft pass-by sounds at a stationary receiver while
in an urban environment. This means effects like spherical spreading,
Doppler shift and reflections at the ground and facades have to be
included in the propagation model. But first it is important to obtain a
good time-frequency representation of an aircraft, and obviously these
depend on the make or type of the aircraft as well as the conditions.
Finally, the aircraft noise has to be reproduced using for example an
Ambisonics setup.</p>
<p>Now, there are quite some challenges here and 'unknowns' to be solved .
While I have a good idea of how I will build such a tool for
auralisation, there are many details requiring attention. An example is
how much does turbulence in the atmosphere influence the propagation?
How to simulate decorrelation? How to reproduce correct over-head
information? And quite some more questions that need answering the
coming three years :-)</p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Ever since I my first visit to Sweden I have been wanting to go to
Lapland during summertime and trek along the Kungsleden from Abisko to
Nikkaluokta. Last month I finally did it! While at times I got rather
frustrated during the trek it was overall a great experience.</p>
<p>Several days before Midsummer,&nbsp;after a 22 hour trainride departing from
Gothenburg, I arrived in Abisko. And there, right next to the train
platform, the trail begins. The first part of the trail through Abisko
National Park is a bit like a highway, with many wide trails. The nature
is already beautiful though, especially the &nbsp;river flowing from
Abiskosjaure to Torneträsk. After about 10 kilometers I noticed
something wasn't right with my left ankle. 'Damn it', I thought, 'not
during this trail'. I continued, had a short break at
Abiskosjaurestugan, and continued to Ratojaure, where I set up camp, and
was joined by a single traveler from Belgium. And of course the sun
never went down, ohhh that great Midsummer sun!</p>
<p>The next morning we continued together to Alesjaurestugan, and from
there on to Tjäkta. Unfortunately my ankle was hurting a lot, and so
after unsuccessfully trying out some things I decided to continue on my
sandals from Alesjaure and bound my shoes to my backpack. What a
relieve, no pain at all! I definitely got some weird faces from people
passing by me though!</p>
<p>The following morning I woke to the sound of rain in rather high
quantities. We decided to stay at our camp, and continue &nbsp;as soon as it
would be dry again. Well, it wouldn't stop raining until the morning
after when we had a perfectly clear blue sky! Nothing better than having
the bright sun in your eyes when you open your tent :-) We decided to
split up and continue solo again. The weather was great, and I continued
in a high pace, passing Tjäkta pass and on my way to Sälka. The route
between Tjäkta and Sälka was amazing!</p>
<p>Early afternoon I arrived in Sälka, felt like I could walk a bit more,
and decided to continue to Kebnekaise mountain station. I decided
against going via Singi but instead to take a shortcut, which lead me to
higher grounds. As soon as I was at the highest point I noticed a storm
front building up in the valley I was about to descent into. Continuing
to Kebnekaise was definitely no option, as the wind speed was increasing
rapidly, and returning to lower grounds didn't appeal to me. So,
instead, I decided to to pitch my tent at this plateau. Well, this was
perhaps a terrible idea. The wind gusts were very strong, causing so
much noise I couldn't sleep at all. Great Midsummer Eve! My plan was to
move on early, but the wind was still strong in the morning, and it
seemed to me it was too strong to pack my tent. Well, after some time I
simply had to move on, so I packed the tent which obviously didn't go so
fluently, and continued down into the valley towards Kebnekaise, at a
certain point loosing the trail ending up in a big heap of mud.</p>
<p>The mountain station is quite a bit different from the cabins or
stugorna along the trail. While those are relatively small and simple
the facilities at the mountain station are huge and the reception with
restaurant is also very luxurious. Too luxurious, if you ask me. Having
such facilities along a trail here in Lapland just doesn't feel right to
me. The same I found of the facilities at Gjendesheim in Jotunheimen,
Norway. Anyway, I basically wasted a day and a half at the mountain
station, hoping a window would open for me to climb the mountain, even
though I knew it would be a bad idea with the injury I was having.
Except for going up during nighttime there was basically no sane
possibility. So, slightly disappointed, I continued to Nikkaluokta,
passing Ladtjojaure&nbsp;and LapDonalds. After some hours and some fierce
battles with mosquitoes I arrived in Nikkaluokta where I spend the night
in a cottage. Noon next day I took the bus to Kiruna and a full day
later I arrived back in Gothenburg. Home sweet home :-)</p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>It's four weeks now that I am back in Sweden. June the 2nd I arrived
back home in Gothenburg. It was quite a change, for sure! But it was
definitely good. I really enjoyed my 4.5 months India experience, but
after some time I was starting to feel like being home again. Let's give
a short summary of the last month or so in India.</p>
<p>I spend almost a month in McLeodGanj, a town a liked and disliked. There
are so many foreign tourists, that you don't have the feeling you're in
India. And this is both a positive and negative thing I found. Anyway,
during my stay there I met again several travelers from before which was
very nice! It's good to see some familiar faces once in a while. After
McLeodGanj - including a night at the Snowline Cafe - I headed to
Srinagar, Kashmir. It was quite a long bus journey; first a 5 hour ride
from Dharamsala to Jammu, and after that a night bus from Jammu to
Srinagar. While the ride was supposed to take about 12 hours it took in
fact 16 due to two punctures, and a driver deciding to sleep it off
instead. Unfortunately for him the police didn't agree with him and put
him to work. The ride turned out to be really nice, with amazing views
and nice discussions.</p>
<p>In Srinagar I spend only a couple of days. Somehow the city didn't
appeal to me. I think it was because it is way too touristic without
offering me any reasons to stay. So, after Srinagar I took the amazing
two-day bus ride to Leh, Ladakh! Amazing views, and nice dangerous small
roads. Awesome road.</p>
<p>Ladakh is beautiful. Certain locations are simply stunning. It is a pity
though that all the valleys are full of military bases. This does
destroy some of the immersion. It's also unfortunate that Leh has been
growing so much; big concrete hotels are appearing everywhere and they
simply don't fit in. Since I had quite some work left on my thesis I
wasn't able to explore much of Ladakh but I will definitely come back
here for trekking, or maybe some teaching? We'll see!</p>

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>In my previous post I wrote how few foreign tourists could be found in
Shimla. Well, I've spend some weeks now here in McLeod Ganj, and I &nbsp;can
tell you it's quite the opposite. You really have to look hard to find
Indian people around here! Okay, they're still here, but seem to be a
minority compared to the huge amounts of Tibetan people and foreign
tourists.</p>
<p>Anyhow, let's continue where I finished last time. I spend quite some
time in Shimla, and during my stay I met again some travelers I met
before in Udaipur and Jodhpur, which was quite nice. Unlike me they have
been to many more places since we split ways so it was very nice to
catch up and hear their stories of their travels. It was actually the
last day for me in Shimla when I met two Canadians I had met before in
Jodhpur. While they decided to spend Holi in Shimla I went back to
Delhi.</p>
<p>So....Delhi and Holi. Quite some people are afraid of this combination,
but I must say there is no reason at all. While it can get chaotic
(drunk rickshaw drivers doing tricks on their rickshaws, waterballoons
coming at you from all directions), it is a VERY nice and colourful day!
I had a great day and stay there and look forward to a next Holi :-)</p>
<p>Some days after Holi I took the bus again, and this time to Dharamsala
or more precise, McLeod Ganj. McLeod Ganj is the area where the Tibetan
government in exile can be found and as such many Tibetan refugees live
here. Many foreigners could also be found due to popularity of the Dalai
Lama and Tibetan&nbsp;Buddhism. While I am one of the foreigners here I must
say I am definitely not here for this reason. Most foreigners that I met
here in McLeod Ganj come to learn about that culture, for meditation or
to smoke.</p>
<p>Again I met some travelers from before here, which was nice to spend
some time with again. By now though they've all left, and so I feel it's
time to move on again as well. As I've been working real hard on my
thesis again for a while (except last week due to a stupid injury) I
feel like having a short break again. Therefore my plan is to go to
Dalhousie for a dat or two, departing at the end of the weekend. After
that I continue my plans by heading to Srinagar. I haven't figured out
yet whether I go there via Udhampur or Jammu. While I don't want to go
via the latter I am told it is easiest to go from there. Hmmm, I'll have
to think about it. Maybe when I go up Triund again and spend the night
at the Snowline Cafe?</p>

<p>Jodhpur has a nice bazaar around the clocktower. Here one can also find
excellent lassis which are actually quite a bit different from the other
lassies I had so far. A lassi is a drink that consists of yogurt mixed
with water and spices. Normally one drinks a lassi but this one is quite
a bit thicker, requiring the use of a spoon. It also had a strong lemon
