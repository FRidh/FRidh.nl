    <p>In March I was at NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, for a four
week research visit. The goal of the visit was to exchange knowledge on
auralization of aircraft and atmospheric turbulence modeling. During this period
we improved a model I had been working on and demonstrated that this model can
be incorporated in the NASA Auralization Framework (NAF).</p>
<p>I was staying with a nice family in the town of Poquoson. While I've grown up
nearby the coast I had never lived this close to the waterside before. I like
the strong wind and smell of salt. It was an interesting experience living in
this part of the United States and quite unlike the places I've lived in so far.</p>
