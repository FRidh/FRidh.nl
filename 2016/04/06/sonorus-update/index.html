    <p>It's been quite a while I've written on this blog about SONORUS, or anything
else in fact. A lot has happened since then.</p>
<p>In October and November I was at Chalmers again for 6 weeks, following some
courses. Furthermore, we had the school on Auralization and Visualization as
well as a workshop around the Gothenburg test site.</p>
<p>After the research visit I attended NixCon in Berlin. NixCon was a conference
about the Nix package manager and the ecosystem around it. Ever since I found
out about Nix it fascinated me. Last summer I began using Nix and in autumn I
switched to NixOS, an operating system entirely managed with Nix.</p>
<p>In January we had another SONORUS workshop, this time in Rome. It was my first
time in Rome and I was glad to finally see the Colosseum as well as the
Apostolic Palace.</p>
<p>In March I went to the U.S. for a four week research visit to NASA Langley
Research Center. I wrote more about that in another post.</p>
<p>And just a couple of days ago we had another workshop, this time in Antwerp, Belgium.</p>
<p>The SONORUS project is almost over. In September there will be a final meeting in Munich.
More about that later...</p>
